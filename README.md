#Rock, Paper, Scissors, Lizard, Spock!
==================

This is a mid-week project I started during my seventh week at Makers Academy. 
This is a JavaScript version of the popular game Rock, Paper, Scissor with the addition of two new picks, Lizard and Spock (as seen in the series Big Bang Theory). The aim of the exercise is to gain basic knowledge of JavaScript, jQuery and Jasmine.

The app has been deployed on Heroku and is available [here] (http://rock-lizard-spock.herokuapp.com). Hope you enjoy it!
